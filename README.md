# Commuter Copilot
is a RAG-based, offline coding assistant. Inspiration for this project came when my commute changed & I found the new route had terrible cell/hotspot/wifi service. My solution was to develop a containerized app so I can run an LLM locally. To improve responses, I indexed tech documentation that was published after the model's knowledge cutoff.
